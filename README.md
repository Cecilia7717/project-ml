## Abstract
Provide a brief summary of your project, including the problem tackled, the methodology used, and the key findings. This section should be concise and no more than 150-200 words.

---

## Introduction
Introduce the problem or question your project addresses. Explain its significance and relevance to machine learning. Include a brief overview of your approach and the objectives of the project.

---

## Problem Statement
Clearly define the problem you aimed to solve or the research question you sought to answer. Include any hypotheses you formulated and the scope of your project.

---

## Related Work
Summarize prior research or existing methods related to your project. Include citations or links to relevant papers, tools, or datasets. Discuss how your work builds upon or differs from these efforts.

---

## Data Description
Describe the dataset(s) you used, including:
- **Source(s)**: Where the data came from (e.g., Kaggle, UCI ML Repository, custom dataset).
- **Size and Format**: Number of rows, features, and data types.
- **Preprocessing**: Steps taken to clean or transform the data, including handling missing values or feature engineering.

---

## Methodology
Outline your approach, including:
1. The algorithms or models used (e.g., linear regression, neural networks, etc.).
2. Details of the training process (e.g., train-test splits, cross-validation).
3. Any hyperparameter tuning performed.
4. Tools and libraries employed (e.g., scikit-learn, PyTorch).

---

## Results
Present the results of your experiments, including:
- Key metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.).
- Comparisons between models or baselines.
- Visualizations (e.g., plots, confusion matrices).

**Example:**

| Model          | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|-----------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Reg.   | 0.85     | 0.84      | 0.83   | 0.84     |
| Random Forest   | 0.90     | 0.89      | 0.88   | 0.89     |

## Discussion
Interpret your results:

- What worked well?
- What challenges or limitations did you encounter?
- How do the results address your problem statement?

---

## Conclusion and Future Work

Summarize the key findings and discuss potential extensions of your work. What would you do differently with more time or resources?
